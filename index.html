 <p>Hi, I'm Cam. This is my personal site about me and my interests, created for the Index “Intro to Coding for Designers” course. </p>

<p>If you’re looking for my actual portfolio, that’s here.</p>

<p>You’re on the homepage right now. 
    Elsewhere on this site you can check out information about:</p>

<nav>
    <ul>
<li><a href="where.html">Where I’m from</a></li>
<li><a href="work.html">What I do for a living and my creative practice,</a></li>
<li>My interests, including <a href="interests/photo.html">photography,</a> <a href="interests/music.html">music</a>, and <a href="interests/movies.html">film</a>.</li>
<li>Or back <a href="index.html">here</a> at home if you need this homepage again.</li>
</ul>
</nav>
<p>You can also get hold of me directly via emailing me at cimorris.studio@gmail.com.</p>
