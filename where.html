    <p>I'm from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, right on the border between two neighborhoods in the North/Northwest part: Germantown and Mt. Airy. I usually just say I'm from Germantown or Mt. Airy depending on what mood I'm in on the day.</p> 
    <p>My family lives in Philly, North Carolina, Florida, France, and the Ivory Coast. I'm Ivorian on my father's side (he moved here from New York from Marseille from Cote d'Ivoire a long time ago. Je parler peu fran√ßais, merci! (But only a little.)</p>
    <p>Depending on the time you read this, I might be in New York, as I'll be moving to Harlem in the spring of 2023.</p>
