   <p> Prior to my current career as a designer my focus was primarily in imagemaking with a focus in photography and videography. Now it's more of a hobby of mine.</p>
   <p>At the moment, I tend to use a Canon T6 digitally (as well as a refurbished Kodak Easyshare digicam) as well as an old Olympus Point and Shoot for film on 35mm.</p>
   <p>I don't post a lot of my work publicly anymore, but some of my photography is still <a href="https://ci.graphics/Photography">on my portoflio site.</a></p>
