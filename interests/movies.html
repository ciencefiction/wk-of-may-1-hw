   <p> As previously mentioned on the page about <a href="../work.html">my work</a>, I previously worked in the media and videography field. I'm a huge tv and film buff, although I don't watch a smuch as I would like. I used to live across the street from a movie theatre in college. </p>
   <p>Some of my favorite films you could probably extrapolate from to get to know me include:
    <ul>
        <li>Do The Right Thing (1989), dir. Spike Lee</li>
        <li>Nowhere (1997), dir. Gregg Araki</li>
        <li>The Matrix (1999), dir. The Wachowski Sisters</li>
        <li>Hackers (1995), dir. Iain Softley</li>
        <li>Moonlight (2016), dir. Barry Jenkins</li>
        <li>Chungking Express (1994), dir. Wong Kar-wai</li>
