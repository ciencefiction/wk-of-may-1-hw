   <p> I'm a big fan of music and it's a huge vector in my life. I like live music, I like playing it, I like writing and reading about it as much as I do listening.</p>
   <p>I've seen around 262 musical acts since 2016 or so at least once.</p>
   <p>Personally, I play the guitar, like to dabble in electronic music production and DJing as a hobby, and my bucket list thing would be to put out a short EP and play a gig live. Maybe one day.</a></p>
