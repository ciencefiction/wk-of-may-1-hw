<p>My day job is as a digital designer (or a visual designer) (or, more specifically, a graphic designer who chips in on the product and UX/UI side every once in a while) at a Big Tech company. It pays the bills. 

    I consider myself both a designer and a researcher, and a critical part of my practice involves not only designing or imagemaking but writing, knowledge and cultural work. I come from the arts and media field prior to tech, and as a student at Temple University I was a Media Studies & Production student which still informs much of my work from a critical lens.</p>

<p>You can read more about that at my actual portfolio site <a href="https://ci.graphics">here.</a> You can get a grasp of what I like to pursue in my research in my are.na page <a href="https://are.na/chaka-m/">here</a>. </p>
